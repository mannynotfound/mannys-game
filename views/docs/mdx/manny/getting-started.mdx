# Getting Started

`manny` is a free, open-source 3D model for use in media, video games,
and cross-platform virtual or augmented reality. manny was created from
a high-resolution photogrammetry capture of software
artist <a href="https://twitter.com/mannynotfound" target="_blank">@mannynotfound</a>
in 2018. Ever since, manny has been using the model for everything
from <a href="https://giphy.com/mannynotfound" target="_blank">making memes</a>
to <a href="https://twitter.com/mannynotfound/status/1438670320987160577" target="_blank">launching NFT projects</a>.

The docs on this page are for
the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/manny" target="_blank">javascript module</a> version of manny.

## Installation

Install manny and its react-three-fiber peer dependency.

<Code language="bash">{'npm install manny @react-three/fiber'}</Code>
## Quick Start

### 1. Create a react-three-fiber canvas

In order for manny to load, he will need to be wrapped in a `<Canvas>` from
react-three-fiber with some custom configuration. We use the `flat` prop
on the canvas to disable tone mapping which makes manny look more flattering.
Also, we'll add some lights so we can see our manny.

<Code language="js">
{`import React from "react";
import { Canvas } from "@react-three/fiber";

const App = () => (
  <Canvas flat camera={{ fov: 45, position: [25, 100, 300] }}>
    <hemisphereLight groundColor={0x444444} />
    <directionalLight castShadow intensity={0.25} position={[0, 200, 100]} />
  </Canvas>
);

export default App;`}
</Code>
_note: Canvas is responsive to fit the parent node, so you can control how 
big it is by changing the parents width and height._

</a>

### 2. Add your manny

Next, create a `<group>` to add the manny model to. Additionally, you'll
want to wrap the manny components in a `<React.Suspense>` so it doesn't hold up your
app while it loads.

<Code language="js">
{`import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import manny from "manny";
import { Canvas } from "@react-three/fiber";

const Manny = () => (
  <group position={[0, -90, 0]}>
    <primitive object={manny()} dispose={null} />
  </group>
);

const App = () => (
  <Canvas flat camera={{ fov: 45, position: [25, 100, 200] }}>
    <Suspense fallback={null}>
      <Manny />
    </Suspense>
    <hemisphereLight groundColor={0x444444} />
    <directionalLight castShadow intensity={0.25} position={[0, 200, 100]} />
  </Canvas>
);

export default App;`}
</Code>

### 3. You're good to go!

<BasicScene />

That should everything needed to render a manny model on the page in a
static pose - check out <Link href="/docs/using-animation">using animation</Link> and <Link href="/docs/adding-controls">adding controls</Link> to bring manny to life!{' '}

### Examples

Manny with custom texture/model:

<Code language="js">
{`const mannyObj = manny({
  modelPath: 'https://asd1337dsa.cloudfront.net/Manny_v2.fbx',
  textureUrl: 'https://asd1337dsa.cloudfront.net/body_texture_inverted.jpg',  
})
`}
</Code>

Manny with default animation:

<Code language="js">
{`const mannyObj = manny({
  animation: 'hurricane kick', // yes this is included by default
})
`}
</Code>

Manny with custom animation:

<Code language="js">
{`const mannyObj = manny({
  animation: 'holding_hands',
  library: {
    holding_hands: {
      url: 'https://asd1337dsa.cloudfront.net/holding_hands.fbx'
    }
  }
})
`}
</Code>
